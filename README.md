# Bike Usage Infographic

The intersection of two of my biggest interests came to life in this project: Cycling and data science! This bike infographic was an assigment for my Data Visualization class as part of the requirements for the Master of Environmental Data Science program at the University of California, Santa Barbara. I had a lot of fun creating this infographic and thinking about the many ways in which I can make my message and the information at habd as clear as possible to viewers. I hope you enjoy looking at it as much as I enjoyed making it!
